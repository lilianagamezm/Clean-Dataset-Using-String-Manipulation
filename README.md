# Clean-Dataset-Using-String-Manipulation
The python script detects spaces of strings and removes any special characters (non-alphanumeric), strips blanks, and transforms words to title cases. 

The cleaned dataset is verified and saved in CSV format. The script performs the below operations:

•	String format transformation

•	Calculate total words with spaces

•	Search the position of spaces at each word

•	Clean dataset (remove special characters and blanks, and convert text to title case) using the CleanDataSet function

•	Output the dataset as a CSV file

•	Verify the clean process 

Real-world cases include data cleaning for natural language processing and dataset analysis. 

The results are accessible in several ways: using a Jupyter notebook built-in to print the outputs and export a spreadsheet that is open in Microsoft Excel, SQL, and MySQL databases.
